# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression

# Background:

The Boston Housing data set contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston. This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University and is now available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Conclusion:

In these exercises I imported Boston Housing data and used python's packages to apply linear regression. The packages I covered were statsmodels, seaborn, and scikit-learn. I generated scatterplots, histograms, and train-test splits to analyze outcomes. I interpreted scipy.stats and statsmodel summaries.
